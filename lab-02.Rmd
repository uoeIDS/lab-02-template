### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```


## Load & join data sets

```{r load-data, message = FALSE}
# Member 2 (pair 1) write code to load File 1 data here:



# Member 4 (pair 2) write code to load File 2 data here:



# Member 1 (pair 1) write code to load File 3 data here:



# Member 3 (pair 2) write code to load File 4 data here:



```



```{r join-data, message = FALSE}
# Member 2 (pair 1) write code to create object 'plastic_data_all':




# Member 4 (pair 2) write code to join your data to 'plastic_data_all':




# Member 1 (pair 1) write code to join your data to 'plastic_data_all':




# Member 3 (pair 2) write code to join your data to 'plastic_data_all':



```


```{r print-data, message = FALSE}
# Member 2 (pair 1) adds code here to view the first 10 rows of 'plastic_data_all'



```
